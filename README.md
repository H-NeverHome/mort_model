### pymort
#### Python implementations of different mortality modeling techniques - for now only a basic Lee-Carter model implementation. 
#### Additional Python-R interoperability is demonstrated with the excellent 'StMoMo'-Package by Andr√©s M Villegas (https://github.com/amvillegas/StMoMo) using rpy2 (https://rpy2.github.io/).
Adapt and use at own risk.
